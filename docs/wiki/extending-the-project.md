# Extending the Data Platform

Use this guide when you need to add a new service, swap dependencies, or tailor the platform to a specific deployment target.

## 1. Scope the Extension
1. Identify whether the change belongs in an existing container or warrants a new one.
2. Capture requirements up front: protocols, external systems, security constraints, scaling expectations.
3. Open an issue describing the desired outcome so reviewers can align on architecture before code changes land.

## 2. Create or Update a Container
- Clone `containers/_template` when introducing a new workload. The skeleton includes metadata, tests, and docs placeholders.
- Edit `container.yaml` to declare:
  - `name`, `description`, and expected runtime arguments.
  - `publish` targets (registry, tags, provenance settings).
  - `tests` to execute after image builds.
- Adapt the Dockerfile following the [Container Development Methodologies](container-development-methodologies.md) playbook.
- Document runtime usage in `containers/<name>/README.md` and link to it from the root README.

## 3. Wire Automation
- Register the container with the CLI: `make build PACKAGE=<name>` should succeed locally.
- Add smoke tests or integration suites under `containers/<name>/tests/` so CI validates future changes.
- Update `.github/workflows/` only when you need bespoke steps; otherwise rely on the shared job matrix.

## 4. Integrate with the Data Plane
- Decide how the new container participates in the platform: does it replace an existing component, or run alongside others?
- Update sample deployments (`README.md`, `docs/maintenance.md`, or `docs/runbooks/`) to explain how operators stitch the service into the stack.
- If the change alters contracts (ports, schemas, storage), document migration steps and default configuration toggles.

## 5. Promote to Production
- Build and scan the image with `make build PACKAGE=<name>` and `make check`.
- Run end-to-end tests using the sample Docker Compose stack or your environment-specific manifests.
- Tag the release following semantic versioning or the upstream project's cadence. Push via `make publish PACKAGE=<name>`.
- Announce the change in release notes, highlighting breaking changes, new environment variables, and rollback instructions.

## 6. Maintain Over Time
- Track upstream releases using the `version` stanza in `container.yaml`. Automate detection when feeds exist.
- Update dependencies quarterly or after CVE advisories, whichever comes first.
- Schedule smoke tests (via CI or cron jobs) to ensure the composed platform still boots with the new component.

Keeping extensions aligned with these steps ensures the platform stays coherent, observable, and portable across environments.
